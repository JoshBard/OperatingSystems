This repository holds my implementation of Copy-on-Write. There are five primary functions, tls_create, tls_destroy, tls_write, tls_read, and tls_clone. In this case TLS stands for thread local storage. Each TLS holds an array of page pointers which are protected and can only be accessed with tls_read and tls_write. tls_clone is not a direct copy, rather its pages point to the same pages as the target thread. Copy-on-Write is implemented in tls_write, where we check if the pages have more than one reference, e.g there is a clone pointing to those pages, and make a copy of the editable pages.
